<p>Hi <%= @proposal.submitter_name || "there" %>,</p>

<p>
  Great news! Your proposal to improve author information on ChooseRuby has been approved and the changes are now live on the site.
</p>

<% if @author.present? %>
  <p>
    <strong>Author:</strong> <%= @author.name %>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can view the updated author profile on ChooseRuby at:<br>
    <%= link_to author_url(@author.slug), author_url(@author.slug) %>
  </p>
<% end %>

<p>
  Thank you for contributing to the Ruby community and helping keep ChooseRuby accurate and comprehensive!
</p>

<p>
  If you notice other author information that could be improved, we'd love to hear about it. Feel free to submit another proposal anytime.

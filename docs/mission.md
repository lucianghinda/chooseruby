# Product Mission

## Pitch

ChooseRuby is a comprehensive, curated directory that helps Ruby developers of all experience levels discover and access the best resources in the Ruby ecosystem by providing an organized, searchable collection of gems, articles, books, courses, tutorials, and tools that answer "How can I do something with Ruby?" and "Why choose Ruby?"

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Existing Ruby Developers**: Developers actively working with Ruby who need to discover tools, gems, and resources for specific problems

## The Problem

### Resource Fragmentation and Discovery

Ruby has a rich, mature ecosystem built over 30 years, but resources are scattered across GitHub, blogs, documentation sites, course platforms, and community forums. Developers waste hours searching for solutions that already exist. Beginners face analysis paralysis with too many outdated or conflicting options, while experienced developers miss valuable tools buried in the noise.

**Our Solution:** A single, curated destination that organizes the entire Ruby ecosystem with clear categorization, search functionality, and community validation. We maintain quality standards while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

### Ecosystem Perception Gap

Many developers perceive Ruby as outdated or declining, unaware of modern innovations like Hotwire, Solid Queue, and the Rails 8 revolution. This perception gap costs the Ruby community talented developers and costs developers the productivity benefits of Ruby's mature, elegant ecosystem.

**Our Solution:** By showcasing the breadth and modernity of Ruby resources, we demonstrate the ecosystem's vitality and answer "Why choose Ruby?" with evidence rather than advocacy.

### No Authoritative Resource Index

Unlike ecosystems with official, comprehensive directories, Ruby lacks a single authoritative source for discovering tools, gems, and learning resources. RubyGems.org lists packages but doesn't curate or categorize effectively. Awesome Ruby lists help but lack search, maintenance, and user contribution workflows.

**Our Solution:** Build the definitive, community-maintained index with professional curation, modern search capabilities, and transparent contribution processes.

## Differentiators

### Comprehensive Curation with Community Input

Unlike GitHub awesome lists that become outdated or overwhelming, we combine professional editorial curation with community contributions. Every resource is reviewed for quality, relevance, and currency. This results in a directory you can trust for recommendations rather than exhaustive but unvalidated lists.

### Answer-Oriented Organization

We organize resources by the questions developers ask: "How do I handle background jobs?", "What's the best testing framework?", "Where should I learn Ruby?". This results in faster discovery and better matches between problems and solutions.

### Ecosystem Showcase

Unlike documentation sites focused on single tools, we present the full Ruby ecosystem as an interconnected whole. This results in developers understanding Ruby's complete capabilities and makes Ruby more attractive to language explorers.

### Modern Search and Discovery

Unlike static awesome lists, we provide full-text search, filtering by resource type and experience level, and a responsive modern interface. This results in developers finding what they need in seconds rather than minutes of scrolling.
